1. A mother vertex in a graph G = (V,E) is a vertex 'v' such that all other vertices in G can be reached by path from v.
Give an algorithm to find the mother vertex in a directed connected graph. If there are more than one mother vertices, then output any one of them. What is the time complexcity of your algorithm.


3. Detect cycle in an undirected graph and directed graph. Two saperate programs for the same.


4. Design an algorithm to test if graph is bipartite or not. 
A bipartite graph, also called a bigraph, is a set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.

5.Design an algorithm to find if there is a path between two given vertices of a graph. Find the length of such a path.
